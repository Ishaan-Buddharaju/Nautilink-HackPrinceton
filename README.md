## Nautilink
Regulating Fishing Supply Chains With Blockchain Protection

## The Problem (inspiration)
Fishing on the high seas is fragmented, unverifiable, and dangerous to the environment

and if unregulated, fishermen commit biblical levels of greed and harm the environment

Illegal, unregulated fishing **steals $20–50 billion** per year from nationally protected ecosystems (Congress 2024)

Bottom trawler **destroys ~3.9 billion acres of seafloor** habitats every single year (F&F Lab 2021)

*an area larger than the U.S. and China combined

Bycatching **discards 38 million tons of marine** life every year (WWF 2009) 

*bycatch -> unintended non-target catch

All because ```modern fishing regulations are unverifiable```

And the root of all evil starts from the consumer perspective, trying to hunt for the cheapest high value deals on fish.

Competitive prices create difficult conditions for fishers to operate in and make up for by cheating the law

But consumers aren't exactly happy about the environment destroyed, 

they just need a way to understand how their choices affect the fishing supply chain.

Instead of relying on a global seafood traceability system is built on some magical thing called trust

we decided to build a system to verify, visualize, and improve the fishing supply chain sustainability

## The Solution
And that is why we created **Nautilink** is a cross-platform block chain integrated system made up of 5 parts aimed to achieve 5 things

**Simplicity**

**Support**
monetary, regulatory empowerment

**Traceability + Transparency**

**Ecocentric**

**Security**

## How it works

Hardware (fishermen, supply chain etc.)

Block Chain Technology (transparent, verifiable)

Mobile App (consumers, fishermen, supply chain etc.)

Web App Dashboard/Database (Regulators)

Personal Assistant (Everyone)

(hardware, mobile app tracking, block chain technology, web app dashboard)

## Challenges we ran into
blockchain.
none of us knew how to work with blockchain web3 technology ☹️👎

much less, know how to mint, burn, transfer, freeze, thaw, delegate, create, update, CPI, BPF compile... everything... ☹️👎

but it's okay because learnt it, built it, and deployed it 😎👍

Also our 4th teammate dropped out a third of the way in, ☹️👎

but it's okay because we met a very cool new teammate and worked well together 😎👍
